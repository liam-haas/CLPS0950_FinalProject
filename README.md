# CLPS0950_FinalProject

This program allows you to predict the product in the reaction between alkenes and HBr.
To run this program, you need to install Python and a number of packages: tkinter, PIL, rdkit, numpy, pandas, math, and sklearn.

Open Tkinter.py and run to script to run the program. The program will prompt you to enter a SMILES string of the alkene you would like to react, e.g., propene would be C=CC and 1-phenyleth-2-ene would be C1=CC=CC=C1C=C.
